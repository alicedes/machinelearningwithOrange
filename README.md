Practical assignment 2: Applying methods of machine learning
Number of points: 15 points
Task:
You will select a dataset for this assignment and apply unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The assignment
aims to develop student skills in machine learning algorithms and analyse the obtained results. The deliverable is a report 
prepared by the student on completing the assignment.
To develop the assignment, the student must use the Orange tool. Its user manual is available in the section “Practical 
assignment” of the e-learning course. In the context of the assignment, the following widgets of the Orange tool will be 
especially valuable: File, Data table, Data Sampler, Bar Plot, Scatter plot, Feature Statistics, Distributions, Test and Score, 
Predictions, Confusion matrix, Silhouette plot, Roc analysis, as well as widgets of different machine learning algorithms.
At the same time, students are allowed to use also Python language. However, the rest of the assignment description 
references the Orange tool, but the same requirements are applied if you use Python.
